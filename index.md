# Questions and Answers
**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting thing to me is that large language models like ChatGPT can answer questions by imitating to the tone and opinions of a person given the speeches made from that person.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

The potential project I'm thinking is to let LLMs to imitate UCSD students and answer UCSD related questions. So I would like to investigate the discussions about UCSD from social medias (like Instagram, Reddit, etc.), and see if these data could be used for my Quarter 2 Project. 

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

I'd like to decide the code structure in the very beginning of the project, and encapsulate the code in class and functions. We are currently writing codes inside a single Jupyter notebook, and the codes become hard to organize as we write more of them. Resturcturing the codes now takes a lot of work, and if we decided the code structure earlier we can save a lot of time and develop more efficiently.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I'd like to learn more data collecting techniques. The approaches of finding data I know includes web scraping, platform APIs, and searching existing datasets. All of these approaches have respective limitations, and I hope to learn more techiques that could help on data collection.
